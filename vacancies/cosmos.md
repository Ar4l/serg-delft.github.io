title: Vacancy (COSMOS)
---

The TU Delft Software Engineering Research Group has the following vacancies: 

## PhD student in Software Testing and DevOps for Cyber-Physical Systems 

The Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) has recently acquired an H2020 EU project called COSMOS that will reinforce the research lines of software testing, evolution, and maintenance at TU Delft by focusing on Cyber-Physical systems.

Emerging Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)—from robotics, transportation, to medical devices—play a crucial role in the quality of life of European citizens and the future of the European economy. Increasing automation to such an extent, however, gives rise to many challenges, at the crux of which lies the hardware and software symbiosis. COSMOS proposes to overcome the strain on developing and evolving high-quality, dependable CPS by employing two key technologies: DevOps and Artificial Intelligence (AI). These technologies offer the potential to address CPS development, verification, and evolution.

### Job requirements

For this project we are seeking enthusiastic Master students interested in obtaining a PhD degree in the cross-section of DevOps, software testing, simulation-based validation & verification (V&V), software evolution, and software quality. The prospective PhD student is expected to do high-quality research: coming up with creative solutions, working diligently to iron out all details and getting a deeper understanding, interacting with peers around the world, but also interacting with practitioners from both the open source and industrial domain to evaluate the research.

- A Master’s degree (or equivalent) in computer science
- A strong interest in software testing, software evolution, artificial intelligence, and/or empirical research
- Strong programming and software engineering skills. Good knowledge of software testing is a definite plus.
- Good communication and presentation skills in English
- Ability to work in an international team
- A healthy dose of creativeness

### How to apply? 
To apply, please create an application package containing:
- A detailed CV (with contact information for 2 references; sending references letters yourself is not necessary)
- A motivation letter that includes a paragraph on your vision of the COSMOS project (e.g., what do you consider to be an urgent topic to address in the area of software testing, how would you go about the project, how does your vision relate to the topics of COSMOS, etc.). Hint: be creative! (a generic letter of motivation is not appreciated)
- A (draft) version of your Master thesis
- Optional: (draft) versions of papers that you have submitted/published
- A detailed transcript of university grades
- Proof of English proficiency

Please send your application package to vacancies-eemcs@tudelft.nl no later than November 1. When applying please mention application number TUD00488.

A pre-employment screening can be part of the application procedure.

### About the research environment

The Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) is part of the department of Software Technology, faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and a member of the research school IPA. The group employs approximately 30 people, comprising full, associate, and assistant professors, lecturers, postdocs, and PhD students. The main research areas for the group include but are not limited to software analytics, software testing, software quality and maintenance, software evolution and search-based software engineering. The involved researchers have developed numerous techniques to make it easier for software developers to (1) understand, (2) maintain and (3) test existing software systems. More information about the group can be found here: [https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl)

SERG is part of the Department of Software Technology (ST), which comprises research groups working on core computer science and engineering topics. The department is responsible for a large part of the curriculum of the BSc and MSc programmes in Computer Science as well as the MSc programme in Embedded Systems. The department’s research mission is to perform excellent research at an internationally-recognised level in the design, construction and analysis of complex, concurrent and cooperative computer and information systems. Inspiration for the research topics is derived largely from technical ICT problems in industry and society. The Department moved into new office and lab space in 2018.

The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) is known worldwide for its high academic quality and the social relevance of its research programmes. The faculty’s excellent facilities accentuate its international position in teaching and research. Within this interdisciplinary and international setting the faculty employs more than 1100 employees, including about 400 graduate students and 4000 undergraduate students. Together they work on a broad range of technical innovations in the fields of sustainable energy, telecommunications, microelectronics, embedded systems, computer and software engineering, artificial intelligence, interactive multimedia and applied mathematics.

Located in a charming college town, TU Delft is the largest and oldest public technological university in the Netherlands. The university is regularly ranked among the most highly-rated worldwide for engineering and technology.
