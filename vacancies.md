The TU Delft Software Engineering Research Group has the following vacancies: 

## PhD student in Software Testing and DevOps for Cyber-Physical Systems

The Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) has recently acquired an H2020 EU project called COSMOS that will reinforce the research lines of software testing, evolution, and maintenance at TU Delft by focusing on Cyber-Physical systems.

Emerging Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)—from robotics, transportation, to medical devices—play a crucial role in the quality of life of European citizens and the future of the European economy. Increasing automation to such an extent, however, gives rise to many challenges, at the crux of which lies the hardware and software symbiosis. COSMOS proposes to overcome the strain on developing and evolving high-quality, dependable CPS by employing two key technologies: DevOps and Artificial Intelligence (AI). These technologies offer the potential to address CPS development, verification, and evolution.

## PhD student in Software Testing

The Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) has recently acquired a NWO Vici
grant called TestShift. The Vici grant is the most prestigious personal
research grant from the Dutch Science Foundation NWO and will reinforce the
software testing research line at Delft University of Technology. 

For this project we are seeking enthusiastic Master students interested in
obtaining a PhD degree in the cross-section of software testing, human computer
interaction, and socio-technical factors in software engineering. The
prospective PhD student is expected to do high-quality research: coming up with
creative solutions, working diligently to iron out all details and getting a
deeper understanding, interacting with peers around the world, but also
interacting with practitioners from both the open source and industrial domain
to evaluate your research.

[TestShift](https://testshiftproject.github.io/) is rooted in empirical
software engineering and will make use of
research methods such as ethnography, longitudinal field studies and case
studies.
