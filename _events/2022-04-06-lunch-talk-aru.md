In this talk, I will present our recent paper titled **Data Smells in
Public Datasets** which was recently accepted in [CAIN
'22](https://conf.researchr.org/home/cain-2022). Following is the
abstract of the paper, the pre-print can be found on
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08007).

***Abstract***

The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in high-stakes domains
such as healthcare, wildlife preservation, autonomous driving and
criminal justice system calls for a data-centric approach to AI. Data
scientists spend the majority of their time studying and wrangling the
data, yet tools to aid them with data analysis are lacking. This study
identifies the recurrent data quality issues in public
datasets. Analogous to code smells, we introduce a novel catalogue of
data smells that can be used to indicate early signs of problems or
technical debt in machine learning systems. To understand the
prevalence of data quality issues in datasets, we analyse 25 public
datasets and identify 14 data smells.
