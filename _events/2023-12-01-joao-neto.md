**Abstract**

GeoBuckets is a shim layer for Scality’s RING, a Hybrid Cloud Storage Management Solution. It facilitates multi-master geo-replication using Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). GeoBuckets comprises two components: GeoD and VersionD.
GeoD is a causally-consistent geo-replication shim for key-value stores, separating concerns related to replication and convergence, while preserving all of the read-only functionality.
A direct extension of GeoD, VersionD allows applications to achieve richer semantics by allowing them to store multiple versions of a given object and apply custom conflict-resolution rules, even on stores lacking versioning support.
