**Abstract**

It is worth looking beyond the pure marketing purpose of the term "digital twin": Digital twins offer us in research a great opportunity to support the lifespan of complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). They enable us to combine models created during CPS engineering with data and models captured during CPS runtime. This connection from models to reality and real-world data allows us to use this information to assess the sustainability of complex, software-intensive systems. In my talk, I will focus on our research on engineering digital twins for sustainability assessment of software systems and CPS using model-driven software engineering and software language engineering methods. The talk will provide an insight into our current research within the German Cluster of Excellence “Internet of Production”, the DFG/ANR project Model-Based DevOps (MBDO) as well as upcoming research initiatives.
