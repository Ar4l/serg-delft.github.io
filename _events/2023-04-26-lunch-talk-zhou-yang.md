***About the speaker***

Currently, I am a PhD student at SMU. I am a member of [Software Analytics Research Group](https://soarsmu.github.io/), supervised by [Prof. David LO.](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/) In the two years, my main focus will be “SE4AI4SE”, trying to explore the following three questions: (1) to what extent AI code models (e.g., CoPilot) leak privacy information of data contributors (e.g., GitHub users)? (2) how can we efficiently eliminate privacy information in these large AI code models without simply retraining them? (3) how to protect the privacy and intellectual property in software repositories from being learned by AI without authorization?
