Title: What’s beyond the accuracy of code models?


**Abstract:**
Large language models of code, such as CoPilot and even ChatGPT, have delivered significant advancements in various code processing tasks. Researchers keep reporting how good their models are, e.g., high accuracy, high precision, etc. However, my recent interest is to explore “what’s beyond the accuracy of code models.“

This presentation will cover three aspects beyond accuracy: security, ethics, and deployment. First, code models also face a series of security threats. We recently highlight the naturalness requirement in attacking model models [1], and we evaluate stealthy backdoor attacks on code generation models [2]. Second, I will present ongoing works that analyze the ethical implications of code models, including data leakage, membership inference, and the right to be forgotten. Third, I will talk about how to compress the size of code models while maintaining their performance so they can be more efficiently deployed [3].
