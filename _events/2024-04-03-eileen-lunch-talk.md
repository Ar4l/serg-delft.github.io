**Abstract**

This talk is about my paper which was recently accepted at ICSE-SEIP'24. In the paper, we investigate the enhancement of traceability between changes and incidents through AIOps methods. The existing quality of change-incident links falls short to the expected reality. High-quality data is crucial for identifying patterns, improving the change deployment process, identifying high-risk changes, and improving incident response. We have researched various change-incident linking methods and replicated them using ING data. In this presentation, I will go into the methods that I used and show the outcomes.
