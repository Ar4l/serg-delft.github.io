**Abstract**

The automotive industry has undergone a profound transformation,
evolving into a software-intensive landscape with a focus on automated
and connected driving technologies. This paradigm shift presents new
challenges and opportunities in the realm of safety. This talk will
explore how safety requirements and their elicitation are evolving to
meet the demands of automated and connected driving, with a spotlight
on the role of open-source software development in shaping the future
of automotive software. The talk will focus on a few dimensions of
software engineering in the context of automotive systems.

Another data-intensive system is continental scale telescopes that use
radiowaves to unravel mysteries of extra-terrestrial objects. The talk
will also give a brief overview of the opportunities for software and
system engineering in radio astronomy.

The Speaker is a software and system engineering researcher at the R&D
department of ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy.
He is also an adjunct researcher in the Software Engineering and
Technology group at Eindhoven University of Technology.
