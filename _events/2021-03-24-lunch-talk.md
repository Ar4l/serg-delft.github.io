**Topic 1: What if(True)? Testing your ML models with metamorphic transformations on Code (Leonhard Applis)**

What does a deep neural network, such as CodeBERT, really learn? The metrics are State of the Art - but we have no clue why. 
With our last project Annibale and me looked into ways to alter the test-set to gain more information on what is happening in that beautiful model of yours. 
We cover everything your heart desires: Machine Learning, Code, Testing and Statistics. So come and join us!
