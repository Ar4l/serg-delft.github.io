**Abstract**

This talk is about our recent submission to ISSTA24 about our new coverage metric for distributed systems and our greybox fuzzing algorithm. I will present how formal models for distributed systems can be utilized to measure the coverage of system behaviours. I will further discuss the application of formal models to concurrency testing of distributed systems through coverage-guided fuzzing. Lastly, I will present our findings on the test coverage and bug finding effectiveness of our fuzzer.
