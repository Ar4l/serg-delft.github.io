**Abstract:**

The last decade has seen an exponential rise in the popularity of AI
and consequently it's adoption into a multitude of fields ranging from
health care, automotive industry and governance. The popularity of
"Big Data" along with the development of dedicated hardware to perform
arithmetic operations (GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, etc.) has enabled AI
researchers to develop a plethora of machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) models. Significant effort has also been put in improving
the performance of said models and accomplish tasks that humans simply
cannot do manually. Unfortunately, very little emphasis has been put
in the actual methodology of working with AI systems, until now.
Software Engineering for Artificial Intelligent (SE4AI) is an emerging
field that explores the problems associated with developing software
with AI components. In this talk, I will provide a broad overview of
the field along with it's current challenges and opportunities. I
expect this talk to be less technical and more philosophical in
nature. Anyone already working on something similar or curious to know
about this topic are welcome!
